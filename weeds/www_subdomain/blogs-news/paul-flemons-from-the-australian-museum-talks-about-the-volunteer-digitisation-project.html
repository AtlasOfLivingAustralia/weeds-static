			<p><strong>Story by Leonie Prater, Australian Museum.</strong></p>
<p>Paul Flemons, Manager of Collection Informatics Unit at the Australian Museum, has been the key driver in delivering an innovative digitisation project with a large group of skilled volunteers.</p>
<p><strong>Q1. How did this project come about?</strong></p>
<p><em>A. Paul: “The idea of volunteers digitising collections is not new. Volunteers have been databasing specimen records for collection managers for many years. The initial concept that led to this project</em><em> </em><em>arose when exploring how the Australian Museum might better leverage volunteers as part of a more systematic approach to digitising our collections. Several staff</em><em>,</em><em> including John Tann and John Gollan</em><em>,</em><em> were very helpful in developing and testing the concepts. </em></p>
<p><em>We developed the concept of imaging the specimens and labels first</em><em>,</em><em> and when the possibility of Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) funding became available we refined the concept into the kernel of what has now been implemented through the efforts of a fabulous team made up of Rhiannon, Leonie, and Michael in collaboration with Dave Britton and his entomology staff.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Q2. What challenges have you faced in establishing the digitising project at the Museum? </strong></p>
<p><em>A. Paul: “There have been many challenges over the years but there are four key challenges I would like to mention:</em></p>
<ol>
<li><em>Funding – in the current climate getting funding for digitising is very difficult – so securing funding to employ the coordinators was the impetus the project needed to get up and running. The ALA’s funding was most appreciated.</em></li>
<li><em>Fear of the unknown – because this approach had never been tried before – museum staff were nervous about potential damage to specimens.</em></li>
<li><em>Closing the data loop – a big challenge with this approach is the transcription of the data labels – and the importing of that data into our collection database, EMu. It has been a slow and methodical process but we now have a process for closing the loop.   </em></li>
<li><em>Getting space and equipping the lab. Space in the Museum is at a premium so getting hold of the large room we now have was great. The Museum, from management through to IT and building services has been great in helping us establish the lab.”</em></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Q3. Where to from here?</strong></p>
<p><em>A. Paul: “We are moving into a consolidation phase of the project by ensuring that the quality of the work is maintained at a high standard. We need to close the data loop effectively and efficiently and optimise data quality. We will continue to work with Entomology but also extend to Malacology and Cultural Collections. To date, we have been working with dry collections and in the future, we will include wet collections which will require new techniques. We have sufficient funding until October 2012, after which we hope to secure ongoing funding for the project.”  </em></p>
<p><strong>Leonie Prater and Rhiannon Stephens</strong> have worked part time on the digitisation Pproject since March 2011. The success of the pilot digitisation project led to the employment of Leonie and Rhiannon who have recruited and trained o a skilled group of volunteers to handle and digitise specimens and archival material in the digitisation Llaboratory.volunteer digitisers in the laboratory to was successful and was funded by ALA to adequately resource the establishment of the lab</p>
<p>Leonie, who was a volunteer on the pilot project before working in this position, has worked in a range of strategic planning and project management positions and has post graduate qualifications. Rhiannon, who has Applied Science qualifications, worked at the Royal Botanic Gardens Herbarium on the Australian Virtual Herbarium project which she really enjoyed. In her spare time, Leonie likes to sail, read, hike, go to theatre and listen to music while Rhiannon enjoys jewellery making, photoshop, reading and going on bike rides to the beach with her children.</p>
<p><strong>Q4. What have been the key challenges in establishing the project?</strong></p>
<p><em>A. Leonie and Rhiannon: “A key challenge was developing a strategic project framework  and implementation plan which had realistic timeframes to furnish and equip an old storage lab into  a fully functioning laboratory with five digitisation workstations and up to 10 trained and skilled volunteer digitisers</em><em>.</em><em> </em></p>
<p><em>There has been a strong emphasis on documentation of the project as it is seen to be cutting edge here in Australia. Other cultural institutions, which may not have the same level of infrastructure, staffing and volunteers can access and adapt the range of documentation, including volunteer induction and training tools  to meet their requirements.  </em></p>
<p><em>Providing a fun learning environment for volunteers is critical to ensure that volunteers remain interested and committed to spending a day a week on this project. Volunteers have been provide d with a comprehensive induction and training session to become skilled and confident digitisers who handle valuable specimens and archival material.  </em></p>
<p><em>We had to develop a good understanding and appreciation of the culture and pressures that Collections  management and staff deal with on a daily basis as their support of this project is only one small part of their work”.   </em></p>
<p><strong>Q5. What have been your key achievements in the position?</strong></p>
<p><em>A. Leonie and Rhiannon: “The project would not exist without a skilled group of volunteers and over the last 6 months, it has been wonderful to see the lab gradually filled with people from different walks of life who are passionate about their work and receive acknowledgement for their contribution to the Museum.  </em></p>
<p><em>An extension of ALA funding for the project was a significant achievement as it demonstrated that the funding body supported the key strategic directions of the project and its application to wider communities”</em><em>.</em><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>Robyn</strong> is one of the earliest volunteers who participated in the pilot project for 2 months in late 2010 and then resumed volunteering when the digitisation lab was established in May 2011.</p>
<p>Robyn spent part of her childhood in Papua New Guinea before moving to Australia with her family. She completed a Bachelor of Pharmacy, Graduate Diploma in Computing, Masters of Environmental Science and is currently completing a Masters of Geoscience. Robyn has worked as a pharmacist and is an IT professional in systems programming and project management. She has many interests including scuba diving, bird watching, geology and hiking. Her recent adventure was to spend 3 weeks on a scientific cruise (CSIRO’s National Marine Facility) to detect the magnetics of the Perth Abyssal Plain and to dredge rocks off the knolls.</p>
<p><strong>Q6. Why do you volunteer on this project?</strong></p>
<p><em>A. Robyn: “I have been a member of the Australian Museum for many years and often attend the lectures which I find very interesting. When a request came for volunteers on the trial digitisation project, I knew, having come from an IT background, how valuable the digitised resource would be</em><em>.</em><em>”</em></p>
<p><strong>Q7. What do you find enjoyable and challenging as a volunteer on this project?</strong></p>
<p><em>A. Robyn: “I really like the photos of the insects I take because when looking at the actual specimen without a camera lens you cannot see the fine detail. The photos show their beauty and believe it or not, they even have distinct personalities! Initially, we digitised a lot of cicadas (i.e. 80 drawers) and I was amazed by how much variety there is amongst them. Now, each week I look forward to seeing what we are working on, which has been tiny tree hoppers, leaf hoppers, plant hoppers, beautiful hawk moths and long legged flies</em><em>.</em><em>”</em></p>
<p><em>“My skills are improving in taking good images. It can be a real challenge handling specimens when they are old and brittle. It is fun reading the labels to see where they have been collected</em><em>,</em><em> and sometimes we can relate to the collection location information and dates. It is interesting to find a collector that has collected the same species of moths for so many years… true dedication</em><em>.</em><em>”</em></p>
<p><em>“It’s a bonus when the Entomology Management, staff and research scientists give us some interesting background information on the insects we are digitising. I really enjoy the “behind the scenes” tour to see the huge range of insects in the collection.”</em></p>
<p><em>“It is an interesting crowd to work with. We always have lunch together and there is no shortage of interesting conversations. The lab is well organised and equipped and there are ongoing improvements.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr Dave Britton</strong>, Collection Manager of Entomology, has been the key player in providing digitisation staff and volunteers with the necessary knowledge, specimen handling skills and enthusiasm for the wonderful world of insects.</p>
<p>Dave, who has a PhD in Agricultural Entomology, has lived on Australia’s East Coast and in Victoria working in the research field at different universities, specialising in entomology across a broad variety of disciplines. He started at the Museum in 2003 and his interests outside of work include parenting, mountain cycling, music, gardening, insect photography, and collecting around his home.</p>
<p><strong>Q8. What are the benefits of the project to Entomology at the Museum?</strong></p>
<p><em>A. Dave: “ The Museum has a mandate to make information that is currently locked in the collection available to as   many people as possible. We have been directly digitising</em> <em>the Collection for a long time before the project began, but the reality is that we do not have the staff resources to do as much as we would like. Within the Collection, we use digital records for a number of things, such as inventory,   tracking internal specimen movements and external specimen loans. The digitisation project complements what we are doing already, and with a collection that contains over 4 million specimens</em><em>,</em><em> it is helping get the information locked in there</em><em>,</em><em> out to our stakeholders.</em></p>
<p><strong>Q9. What are the challenges you have experienced with the project?</strong></p>
<p><em>A. Dave: </em>“<em>The principle one is having the specimens handled by volunteers who may not have any experience or skills to handle specimens that are often fragile. In itself, this creates a subset of what we can provide to the project … we have focused on the dry collection, which in turn is much smaller than the ethanol-preserved collection, so there is still a mountain of work to be done.</em></p>
<p><em>“Another challenge is providing sorted specimens with up to date and meaningful taxonomic information associated with them. Finding specimens that are physically suitable for handling by volunteers, and have good taxonomic data means that only a portion of the collection is currently suitable. What is required is added investment in planning and curation, which requires more money to pay qualified staff. I guess there is no such thing as a free lunch!” </em></p>
<p><em>“In terms of the data, there has been a lot of discussion about what do we do with the data when it is imported from the ALA online volunteer portal project to our internal data base. With each stage, we are looking at it and refining our processes to make the system work for us.”  </em></p>
<p><strong>Q10. Will this project be useful for other Museums?</strong></p>
<p><em>A. Dave: </em>“<em>Yes, I think so. There is a natural concern about handing specimens over to volunteers with no background in it.</em><em>.</em><em> People who work with specimens are very fussy about the accuracy of information and there are examples elsewhere of shoddy information out there. Regular meetings to express any concerns helped sort out these issues on this project.”  </em></p>
<p><strong>Linda</strong> is a new volunteer recruit who has been volunteering for 2 months.</p>
<p>Linda has lived primarily in Australia but had a year in the UK when she was travelling around Europe. She has a Bachelor of Applied Science (Biomedical Science) and a Bachelor of Interior Design. Linda has worked as a medical research scientist, interior designer and computer programmer and she enjoys sailing, travelling, photography, handicrafts, cake decorating and reading.</p>
<p><strong>Q11. Why do you volunteer on this project?</strong></p>
<p><em>A. Linda: “Basically, I am between jobs at the moment so I decided to do something that is interesting and useful. I like Museums and Art Galleries so I looked at their websites to see what was available and the digitisation project matched my skills”.</em></p>
<p>What do you find enjoyable and challenging as a volunteer on this project?</p>
<p>“<em>I enjoy seeing the variety of insects, even within the same subfamily. You see a white moth and you don’t notice the details until you take an image which magnifies it so much that you really see its different bits which are often truly amazing. Some are very cute, adorable and some are not!”</em></p>
<p><em>“I find it challenging to take a very old fragile label off the pin without it breaking” </em></p>
<p><em>“I like the diversity of people who come here – there are many interesting life stories and interests shared. It adds another dimension to home life and friends always find it interesting to know more about it. Sometimes, people think it is a bit strange to photograph dead insects.” </em></p>
<p><em>“It’s fun and we are always laughing about something or other. I really enjoy going on the “behind the scenes” tours and talks on insects because you feel that your contribution is valued by getting additional information.”</em></p>
