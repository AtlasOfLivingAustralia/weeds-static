            <h3>By Ian McDonald</h3>
<img class="alignright  wp-image-30992" title="marine-society-logo" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/www_subdomain/marine-society-logo.jpg" alt=""/>Have you ever wondered how the <strong>Atlas of Living Australia</strong> might be useful for you? Well a few years ago Libby Hepburn did just that. Having lived on the eastern coast of Australia near Merimbula for the best part of 16 years she has been working with community biodiversity projects for much of that time. She was the project manager for the then embryonic Sapphire Coast Marine Discovery CentreÂ for 8 years and continues to be strongly involved with the <a href="http://www.alcw.org.au/index.php/sapphire-coast-marine-society/" target="_blank">Sapphire Coast Marine Society</a> which has been in existence for just over 10 years.
The local coast is especially interesting for its marine biodiversity because of the meeting of two great ocean currents and it, like many places in Australia, is also sensitive to changes in climate. Libby felt strongly that everyone who observes the species that inhabit the region should be encouraged to record it, so that members of the community can note the changes as they occur and have a record for future generations. For many years she wondered if there was some way that her fellow naturalists could record âonlineâ the species they were seeing when they were walking along the beach or while swimming and snorkelling, so this information could be saved and shared.
Everyone agreed that it would be great if some sort of &#8216;online databaseâ was openly accessible but as of yet nothing had been created. Various programs were recommended by colleagues but they were either too expensive or too difficult for non-technical people such as Libby and her friends to work with. It was just after 2007 that Libby found out about the <a href="http://www.ala.org.au/">Atlas of Living Australia</a>. She read how it was established to achieve a &#8216;one stop shopâ online recording system for biodiversity data in Australia. It sounded ideal, so she approached AtlasÂ staff about her idea and after initial discussions it became apparent thatÂ the Atlas of Living AustrliaÂ could definitely help the Marine Society achieve their goal of developing an online portal so they could start to build an atlas of biodiversity of their coastline.
<a href="http://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/turning-those-long-walks-along-the-beach-into-science/attachment/alcw_logo-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-30993"><img class="wp-image-30993 alignright" title="alcw_logo" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/www_subdomain/alcw_logo-233x116-custom.jpg" alt="" width="233" height="116"/></a>First things first, the marine society needed to purchase and set up a website so they could linkÂ up with theÂ Atlas biodiversity portal. So began the <a href="http://www.alcw.org.au/">Atlas of Life in the Coastal Wilderness</a> (ALCW) website. Having their own website brought the society into the 21<sup>st</sup> century and also meant they could freely administer the website (on their own) and change the layout so it was user friendly for their members and users. They could also announce when they were undertaking community surveys, publish recent news and stories and highlight events and achievements.
Once the website was created, the Atlas team created the <a href="http://alcw.ala.org.au/bdrs-core/alcw/home.htm">ALCW data portal</a>, which could be linked from the ALCW website. This portal collects all information from their surveys and observations which have been uploaded to the online database. Since its creation in late 2011 the portal has attracted 109 users and 2770 records have been uploaded for the south coast of NSW region.
The ALCW website states how theirs is a bioregion of particular interest as it spans the landscape from the Great Dividing Range in the west to the southern coast of New South Wales and the northern coast of Victoria. As well as great tracts of National Park forests, heathland and alpine landscapes, this is a coastline of spectacular and unspoiled beauty. In the ocean the rich upwellingâs and significant biodiversity are due to the warm Eastern Australian Current flowing from the north, meeting the cold, nutrient rich current from the Antarctic. The coastal wilderness is the first place where the humpback whales feed on their migrations south after breeding in the tropics.

The society has been very successful in increasing the knowledge and awareness about the special marine environmentÂ they have in the region. However they didnât just want marine species records in the portal and also wanted plants in local parks,Â land animalsÂ in the forests and even whether there are invasive species such as weeds or pest animas.
In 2012, the ALCW had one of their most successful surveying events called the â<a href="http://www.alcw.org.au/index.php/729-2/">Bermagui bioblitz</a>.â This saw over 300 people take part adding over 1600 records to their portal and 855 new species in a 30 hour period. There were 42 surveys undertaken across a wide range of habitats during the days and night. The bioblitz got lots of media attention and even had people from interstate come and attend and take part. It was a massive effort needing people with varying expertise such as IT gurus, ecologists and the passion of community members and school children to search for new species.
Not only was this bioblitz engaging with the community, it was thoroughly enjoyed by scientists, naturalists and community members alike and the data gathered is also helping the ALA achieving its goals of becoming the most extensive biodiversity portal in Australia. Since the Bermagui Bioblitz, other community and special interest research groups have come forward to contribute. ALCW is now working to increase its database by adding historical data collected in previous years and research projects. To that end they held a âCelebration of the History of Science in our Regionâ Forum late 2012. There were 12 senior researchers presenting the work they had undertaken in the region, including that of well-known ornithologist <a href="http://trove.nla.gov.au/people/643331?c=people">Peter Fullag</a><a href="http://trove.nla.gov.au/people/643331?c=people">a</a><a href="http://trove.nla.gov.au/people/643331?c=people">r</a> who has undertaken 53 consecutive years of seabird research on Montague Island. ALCW intends to revisit some of the early research projects to see how things have changed, and in future to work with the guidance of these scientists to establish a range of valuable long-term monitoring projects.
ALCW have undertaken planning sessions on future key projects, how they can improve their data portal and whether they can develop an âappâ so that people can use their mobile to record observations. So the collaboration with the ALA is still going strong.Â If you are interested in contributing to the ALCW project or just finding out more information about how they started their data portal - contact the committee at <a href="http://www.alcw.org.au/index.php/get-involved/join-us/">http://www.alcw.org.au/index.php/get-involved/join-us/</a> and fill in their online form to become a citizen scientist yourself, or sign up to their website to get news of all new posts of sightings and upcoming events and news.

          <p class="subject-byline"><!--By Ian McDonald, -->December 12, 2012</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ala.org.au/">Atlas of Living Australia</a> now has over 35 million records on Australian species freely and openly available through their website. What is not commonly known is that all the capabilities behind the delivery and visualisation of these records are also freely available via open âweb services.â The Atlas encourages others to build new systems using these web services to further increase awareness of biodiversity in Australia.</p>
<p><strong>Geoff Shuetrim</strong> has done exactly this and describes how a family trip to the Daintree Rainforest in 2010 led him to develop the <a href="http://www.gaiaguide.info/Hierarchy.html">Gaia Guide</a>. Being often frustrated by the inability to recognise the amazing biodiversity within the environment, it became clear that for anything to be identified beyond the superstars of the plant and animal kingdoms, he was on his own.</p>
<p>While it was possible to identify something as a Cassowary, how could he be sure it was a âSouthernâ Cassowary when he was so far north? Not having a field bird guide handy,Â as it was left behind to lighten the weight, such questions were difficult to answer</p>
<div id="attachment_30727" style="width: 284px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/atlas-of-living-australia-making-field-guides-accessible/attachment/cassowary/" rel="attachment wp-att-30727" class="broken_link"><img class=" wp-image-30727" title="cassowary" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2012/12/www_subdomain/cassowary-274x193-custom.jpg" alt="" width="274" height="193"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A Southern Cassowary near Cow Bay, North Queensland (Source: Geoff Shuetrim)</p></div>
<p>He states how it took almost a week to learn that those cute little black frogs covering the ground in the morning were actually cane toads.</p>
<div id="attachment_30728" style="width: 289px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/atlas-of-living-australia-making-field-guides-accessible/attachment/back-camera/" rel="attachment wp-att-30728" class="broken_link"><img class=" wp-image-30728" title="Back Camera" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2012/12/www_subdomain/canetoad-279x202-custom.jpg" alt="" width="279" height="202"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Young cane toad in the Daintree Rainforest, North Queensland (Source: Geoff Shuetrim)</p></div>
<p>In a place as rich and interesting as the Daintree Rainforest, he would have needed more field guides than he could ever carry to really appreciate what he and his family had travelled so far to see. There had to be a better way.</p>
<p>Today, just a little over two years later, a new field guide system is becoming one such way.Â  <strong>The Gaia Guide</strong> is a functioning website that actively involves its users in all aspects of content creation. Its distinctive features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is freely available online without subscription;</li>
<li>All data is available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> or similar license;</li>
<li>Users are able to contribute to both species descriptions and observations;</li>
<li>Data is easily exported via web services to mobile devices based on user location and/or field of interest; and</li>
<li>The process of content creation actively leverages other web services such as those from the <strong>Atlas of Living Australia (Atlas)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is this last point, about leveraging other web services, that needs emphasis. With the increasing use of smart phones, a new frontier for field guides is allowing the weighty backpack full of guides to be replaced by a single slim device.Â  While slightly less obvious it can still be frustrating for users if you have a device with 10 or more different guides on it, each specialising in a different group of species or part of the world.</p>
<p>Users need to be able to easily select the appropriate data to take with them, depending on their interests and their location. When exploring the Daintree, I donât want crocodile identification to be slowed down by the inclusion of data about Komodo Dragons. When I am bird watching, I donât want search results for species with blue in their plumage to return a list of matching species that also includes the Ulysses butterfly and a bewildering array of parrotfish.</p>
<p>Meeting these user requirements is challenging. The first obstacle involves creating enough content that the appropriate data is available in the first place.Â  The second involves enabling the user to easily filter that large body of data to only take with them descriptions that are relevant to their explorations.Â  Without such filtering, users are easily confused by irrelevant options when making identifications. Also, inappropriate demands are placed on the storage and processing capabilities of their devices if too much data pre-downloaded.</p>
<p>These challenges would be extremely difficult to address without the assistance of web services like those provided by Atlas.</p>
<h2>Development of the Gaia Guide</h2>
<div class="mceTemp">
<dl id="attachment_30729" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 250px;">
<dt class="wp-caption-dt"><a href="http://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/atlas-of-living-australia-making-field-guides-accessible/attachment/logo/" rel="attachment wp-att-30729"><img class="size-full wp-image-30729" title="logo" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2012/12/www_subdomain/logo.png" alt="" width="240" height="115"/></a></dt>
<dd class="wp-caption-dd"><strong>www.gaiaguide.info</strong></dd>
</dl>
<p>Species descriptions in the Gaia Guide are created through a web interface that allows direct editing of all aspects of a description, including:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>images,</li>
<li>sound recordings,</li>
<li>distribution maps,</li>
<li>analysis of species colouration,</li>
<li>diet,</li>
<li>size,</li>
<li>conservation status, and</li>
<li>links to related websites.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the Gaia Guide, these species descriptions are organised into hierarchies, known as field guides.Â  Many of these field guides are naturally organised according to taxonomic groupings. For example, there is a taxonomic hierarchy of all birds encountered in or around Australia.Â  Similarly there is a taxonomic hierarchy of all species found in and around the town of Yungaburra in Queensland.Â  Like descriptions, these hierarchies can also be edited directly through the Gaia Guide web interface.</p>
<p>Manual editing can quickly become an overwhelming burden.Â  The bird guide includes in excess of 800 species, while the Yungaburra guide currently includes 905 animals, 1,389 plants and 95 fungi.</p>
<p>This is where features from the Atlas website can help. Atlas web services have allowed the Gaia Guide to quickly get answers to key questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What species are found within a particular region of Australia?</li>
<li>What species, within a given taxonomic ranking, are found within that region?</li>
<li>What is the full taxonomic classification of any given species?</li>
<li>What common names and synonyms are used to refer to a given species?</li>
</ul>
<p>With the answers to these questions, Gaia Guide has been able to fully automate the creation of any field guide hierarchy for Australia that is based on a taxonomic organisation.</p>
<p>For example, to produce a guide to the biodiversity in the Tarkine wilderness, simply select the region of interest on a <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google map</a>, nominate which taxonomic group (birds, insects, reptiles etc.) is of interest, and set the server to work. Within minutes an email is returned, indicating that the new guide is ready for review.</p>
<p>The new guide has been constructed based upon careful analysis of Atlasâs taxonomic information, scientific names and synonyms to ensure maximum re-use of existing species descriptions in the Gaia Guide.</p>
<p>All species in the new guide that have already been documented are ready to use immediately.Â  For new species, the Atlas provides a stub description, including the scientific name, a common name (if there is one), and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSID">Life Science Identifier</a> that uniquely identifies the species within the Atlas.</p>
<p>The services offered by Atlas do not stop there.Â  The first step in fleshing out a stub description is to include a distribution map. Fortunately an up-to-date map can be included from Atlas at a single click that triggers a call to the appropriate Atlas web service. The listing for the mapping services is here: <a href="http://biocache.ala.org.au/ws">http://biocache.ala.org.au/ws</a>. See &#8220;Mapping Services&#8221;.</p>
<p>Next, up, the description needs some images.Â  Again the Atlas web services can supply a list of images associated with the species. The listing for these services is here: <a href="http://biocache.ala.org.au/ws">http://bie.ala.org.au/ws</a>. See the &#8220;Get Image&#8221; service under &#8220;Species&#8221;. GBIF alsoÂ have a web service listing/tutorial here:Â  <a href="http://www.gbif.org/developer/summary">http://www.gbif.org/developer/summary</a>.</p>
<p>To my knowledge there is an overarching catalogue of web services from the GBIF nodes. To produce this would require visiting the separate GBIF node sites which vary considerably in offerings.</p>
<p>While not all of the images meet Gaia Guideâs licensing criteria a good number do and Atlas enables the user to select appropriate images from a menu of possibilities, tapping into resources like <a href="http://www.eol.org/">Encyclopedia Of Life</a>, <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> and many more.Â  Content editors still need to verify ownership, licensing and image labelling but at least image discovery has been done for them.</p>
<p>With the basics in place, content editors can introduce a range of additional details, again querying against web services.Â  Gaia Guide allows real-time validation of scientific names using information exposed by the <a href="http://www.marinespecies.org/">World Register of Marine Species</a> and the <a href="http://www.itis.gov/">Integrated Taxonomic System</a>.</p>
<p>Confident of the scientific classification and armed with a reasonable idea of how the species looks and where it is found, content editors need to fill in the details.Â  Again, Gaia Guide provides assistance by automating the process of searching for related web pages including <a href="http://www.fishbase.org/">FishBase</a>, <a href="http://www.eol.org/">Encyclopedia Of Life</a>, <a href="http://www.arod.com.au/">Australian Reptiles Online Database</a>, and <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, all of which are handy stepping off points for the learning process.</p>
<h2>Augmenting distribution maps by collecting observations</h2>
<p>Given an adequate species description, users can begin the process of recording their own observations through the Gaia Guide. Instead of being limited to just those observations recorded directly in Gaia Guide, users are again assisted by the Atlas. In a single operation, content editors can trigger the download of all observations for a species from Atlas or just those observations for one or more species for a region of interest.Â  This provides immediate context for the observations being recorded through the Gaia Guide.</p>
<p>Longer term, as observation data accumulates, Gaia Guide will offer a range of services showing both seasonal and trend variations in species distribution, directly producing its own suggestions about where and when to go looking for a species of interest.Â  Until sufficient data is available, however, it is a lot easier to pass the job of distribution analysis back to Atlas.</p>
<p>The Gaia Guide will also supply data to the Atlas through our own open web services.Â  We expose observation data in a format complying with the International âDarwin Coreâ standard as used by the Atlas such that the Atlas can automatically harvest new and updated observations on a weekly basis.Â  Again this is trivially easy, as explained on an earlier <a href="http://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/data/sharing-data-through-the-atlas/">Atlas blog entry</a>.</p>
<p>Once uploaded to the Atlas, the Gaia Guide observations are validated and augmented with a range of additional information. The results of this validation and augmentation process are directly accessible on the <a href="http://collections.ala.org.au/public/show/dr714">Atlas page</a> devoted to data sourced from the Gaia Guide.Â  Validated observations are incorporated into the distribution maps prepared by the Atlas, ready for updating back in the Gaia Guide system.Â  How convenient and cost effective is that? Gaia Guide gets to benefit immediately from the Atlasâs investment in data quality.Â  Gaia Guide also avoids the costs of implementing its own accuracy assessment systems for uploaded observations.</p>
<h2>Assisted data selection</h2>
<p>Looking to the future, the Atlas will also help the Gaia Guide to address the second major challenge facing users: the selection of just that data relevant to their next field-trip.</p>
<p>Using the same technology that drives creation of field guides today, Gaia Guide will enable users to intuitively harness the web services of the Atlas to choose just those subsets of the Gaia Guide that are directly relevant to their planned activities.Â  Users will nominate a region, target groups of species, and a set of Gaia Guide field guides.Â  The Atlas will identify the set of relevant species and package up their descriptions, their supporting multimedia resources, and the relevant branches of the hierarchical field guides. The data packages, once defined, can be downloaded directly onto usersâ mobile devices.</p>
<p>This data selection process is talked about as a future offering only because Gaia Guide is still undergoing load testing and access to computationally heavy activities are being carefully controlled for members of the public.</p>
<h2>Going mobile</h2>
<p>In the meantime, Gaia Guide has begun to roll out simpler mobile field guides on the <a href="http://www.android.com/">Android</a> platform.Â  These come in three flavours: the traditional plain vanilla guide; the regional speciality guide; and the design-your-own guide.</p>
<p>The plain vanilla guide is based upon a single field guide hierarchy in Gaia Guide.Â  The most complete such guide is for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.gaiaguide.android.app.australianbirds">Australian birds</a>.Â  While, in some areas, the data still falls short of that available in commercial guides, the quality and range of species descriptions and supporting images is impressive and largely attributable to the foundation provided by the Atlas. Considering that the data content in the mobile application has been collated by a few individuals in their spare time over a period of weeks, it is a remarkably useful resource already.</p>
<p>The regional-speciality field guide is typified by the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.gaiaguide.android.app.ladyelliot">guide to Lady Elliot Island</a>, a beautiful coral cay on the southern tip of Australiaâs Great Barrier Reef.Â  Drawing on species descriptions prepared on sister sites run by the <a href="http://www.gaiaguide.info/lirs/" class="broken_link">Lizard Island Research Station</a> and The <a href="https://wayback.archive.orghttp://fieldguide.sims.org.au/Hierarchy.html">Sydney Institute of Marine Science</a>, and using the Atlas to identify local species, Gaia Guide produced a mobile application covering many of the species on Lady Elliot Island in a matter of days.Â  Packaging up the content for that guide was trivial.Â  While the guide remains incomplete, it is already more useful than alternative guides to the islandâs fauna and flora.</p>
<p>The region-specific application also makes it simple to influence Atlasâs set of locally occurring species.Â  As local observations accumulate through the Lady Elliot Island field guide, they feed back to the Atlas, making Atlas species selections increasingly informative.</p>
<p>The third flavour of field guide enables users to customise the information they take with them.Â  Known as <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.gaiaguide.android.app.premium">Gaia Guide Mobile</a>, it enables users to nominate branches of the field guides that they want to use offline.Â  While online, they can then trigger the download of data, totally tailoring the species identification support that they receive in the field.</p>
<h2>Looking to the future</h2>
<p>Gaia Guide still has a long way to go until it fully supports our family trips into Australiaâs wild places but the project has developed surprisingly quickly in its two years, largely because Australia has had the foresight to fund and resource a publicly accessible centralised biodiversity database.Â  Without the ability to rapidly query for the existence of species by location, Gaia Guide would still be largely populated by the relatively small amounts of information sourced from collaborating scientific institutions.</p>
<p>The impact of the Atlas of Living Australia is probably best assessed by comparing Gaia Guide data for Australia to Gaia Guide data for other countries.Â  Australian data is plentiful.Â  Data for much of the rest of the world remains considerably more difficult to access. Hopefully the creation of services like Gaia Guide, on top of resources like the Atlas of Living Australia will motivate other countries to make similar investments in making their own environmental heritage accessible to both the scientific community and the broader community.</p>

<div class="mceTemp">A three year Atlas of Living Australia funded contract with the Australian Biological Resources Study has resulted in Australian researchers adding 29,864 species names to the Australian Faunal Directory and the Australian Plant Name Index. The contract was part of the Australian National Species Lists project.</div>
<div class="mceTemp">Â </div>
<div class="mceTemp">The <a href="http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/">Australian Biological Resources Study (ABRS)</a> component of the National Species Lists (NSL) project set out to update the Australian Faunal Directory (AFD) and to integrate names information for algae and lichens into the Australian Plant Name Index (APNI).</div>
<div class="mceTemp">Â </div>
<div class="mceTemp">The names data sets are a critical part of biodiversity informatics infrastructure. For the Atlas of Living Australia, the lists provide the framework for integrating data. Dr John La Salle, Director of the Atlas has said âthe species names delivered through this project are absolutely essential for the Atlas system itself and the overall study of biodiversity in Australia.â</div>

<p>The names datasets include information on current name, synonymy, authority, place and date of publication and protologue.</p>
<h2><strong><em>Fauna</em>:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>28,305 accepted species names were added to AFD via the new editing interface.</li>
<li>An additional 32,250 modifications and updates were made to species names.</li>
<li>The AFD now holds 112,504 accepted species records (close to 90% of the accepted, described species of fauna inAustralia).</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong><em>Algae</em>:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>The freshwater and marine algae datasets are being combinedÂ  in the APNI data structure</li>
<li>There was an increase of 1,295 accepted algae species, with this project delivering 7,309 accepted species of algae to the APNI data structure.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong><em>Lichens</em>:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>The lichen dataset was up-to-date prior to the project commencement.</li>
<li>Following recent additions the dataset has increased to 3,528 accepted species.</li>
</ul>
<p>ABRS managed 46 contracts for delivery of NSL names information over the three years of the project, with 44 of these for delivery of species information to the AFD. Some 104 external specialists contributed to the ABRS component of the NSL project. They were responsible for updating and compiling taxonomic and nomenclatural information about fauna and algae. The project formally concluded in September 2012, however, additions to the databases are still occurring with compilers still adding data to the AFD.</p>

<p>At coffee with a friend recently we chatted about our latest smartphone app discovery while tweeting about the conversation, and sharing the link via Facebook. It occurred to me that I do a lot more with my phone these days than makes calls and send texts. Thanks to these nifty little tools we can identify and purchase the song playing in the cafÃ©, edit the photo we just took, find out exactly what time our bus will arrive, and practically anything else in between.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">With worldwide smartphone sales estimated to reachÂ <a title="Global mobile statistics" href="http://mobithinking.com/mobile-marketing-tools/latest-mobile-stats/a" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">686 million by the end of 2012</span></a>, it seems that many people are embracing the new technology. As the technological capability progresses so too does the functionality and variety of apps that they support. And science is getting on board.</p>
<p>AÂ <a title="App on ALA website" href="http://root.ala.org.au/bdrs-core/koalacount/home.htm" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">smartphone app</span></a>Â released this week is turning citizens into scientists. Citizen science is becoming an increasingly popular phenomenon and with the technology so easily accessible, why not? All you need is a smartphone, a keen eye, and a case of the curiosities.Â </p>
<div id="attachment_30471" style="width: 236px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/koalas-stand-up-and-be-counted-by-smart-phones/attachment/koala-count-app-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-30471" class="broken_link"><img class="size-medium wp-image-30471" title="koala-count-app" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2012/11/www_subdomain/koala-count-app1-226x238.jpg" alt="" width="226" height="238"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Count those little furry bears with our nifty app</p></div>
<p>The app has been developed byÂ CSIRO and theÂ <a title="ALA website" href="http://www.ala.org.au/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Atlas of Living AustraliaÂ </span></a>to support South AustraliaâsÂ <a title="Koala count" href="http://root.ala.org.au/bdrs-core/koalacount/home.htm" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Great Koala Count</span></a>, which will take place on Wednesday, 28thÂ November. The day will see South Australians don their citizen science hats and go forth to collect a count of Australiaâs most loveable marsupial â the koala.Â  The project will utilise the manpower of society and smartphone technology to help scientists understand a bit more about our favourite Australian mascot.</p>
<p>Research scientist, Dr Andrew Baker, has been involved in developing the app and believes that it is a really exciting new way of doing science.Â &#8220;To ensure reliable results and accurate conclusions, we need a sufficient amount of data for our research,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more data we have, the more reliable our results. But scientists, of course, canât be everywhere at once.Â By using apps like this, we can get around this problem as it means that weâve got lots of people on the ground taking verifiable observations at lots of locations in a short period of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the app makes taking these observations a breeze. Snap a photo, record your observations, the phoneâs inbuilt GPS records your specific location and, hey presto, youâve got your first data point. The team even made a video to demonstrate the app in action, check out theÂ video link - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3intVZvZsPM">How to use smart phone app</a>.</p>
<p>The applications for this technology and software development are endless, and the practicality of using phones as portable data recorders points to a strong future in this field. They remove the need to transfer recordings from notebooks to computers, which is time-consuming and increases the risk of error. They provide verifiable data through photos and GPS recordings. And perhaps best of all, they allow everyone from kindergarten kids to retired professors of ecology to get involved in scientific research about the natural world around us.</p>
