            <p>Itâs National Science Week this week, and thereâs lots of things to get involved in, including the Whale Shark Race Around the World. The Race which officially kicked off yesterday, will see schools around the country join scientists in tracking the movements of the worldâs biggest fish - the Whale Shark.</p><p>ECOCEAN is Australiaâs only not-for-profit research organisation dedicated to conserving the whale shark. As well as expanding our knowledge of whale shark movements and distribution in the south-eastern Indian Ocean, their research has also expanded the learning opportunities for Western Australian school students through the Whale Shark Race Around the World.</p><div id="attachment_38298" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img width="1024" height="768" class="size-large wp-image-38298" alt="" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2017/08/www_subdomain/Swim3_30.7.15lge-1024x768.jpg" srcset="../../wp-content/uploads/2017/08/www_subdomain/Swim3_30.7.15lge-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ../../wp-content/uploads/2017/08/www_subdomain/Swim3_30.7.15lge-300x225.jpg 300w, ../../wp-content/uploads/2017/08/www_subdomain/Swim3_30.7.15lge-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"/><p class="wp-caption-text">The Whale Shark Race Around the World kicked off on 14th August 2017 just in time for National Science Week. Image credit: ECOCEAN</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Whale Shark Race Around the World started in 2015 with schools around Western Australia sponsoring satellite tags that were deployed on whale sharks at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia. The Race is a joint ECOCEAN-Department of Education program designed to inspire students in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) learning. The tracks of the tagged sharks are available for anyone to see on ALAâs Zoatrack (<a href="http://www.zoatrack.org/">www.zoatrack.org</a>) platform, so students are able to follow the movements of their sharks. Samantha Reynolds is one of the lead researchers for the project, and she said, âWe bring real-world scientific research directly into the classroom and use the worldâs biggest fish to get kids excited about science and marine conservationâ.</p><p>For this yearâs race, teachers and students will be able to use ZoaTrack visualisation and analysis tools in their lessons and will have access to the ongoing tracking of the sharks. Involvement in the race will support students and teachers to further develop their STEM capabilities, including: critical analysis and creative thinking, deepen their knowledge and understanding of the whale shark, the marine environment of Western Australia and scientific research. Teaching and learning resources developed by the Department of Education are designed to support teachers and students to engage in innovative and interactive STEM learning activities.</p><p>Tagging of whale sharks for the 2017 Race Around the World has been happening over the past few weeks, and researchers have been tagging large, mature whale sharks, hoping to gain insights into where they go to breed. âWeâd like to find some clues to where whale sharks go to find loveâ, said Ms Reynolds, âbecause despite being the biggest fish in the sea, we still donât know where they mate or give birthâ she explained.</p><div id="attachment_38297" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img width="1024" height="646" class="size-large wp-image-38297" alt="" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2017/08/www_subdomain/SReynolds_photographs_shark_copyright_Janine_Marx-1024x646.jpg" srcset="../../wp-content/uploads/2017/08/www_subdomain/SReynolds_photographs_shark_copyright_Janine_Marx-1024x646.jpg 1024w, ../../wp-content/uploads/2017/08/www_subdomain/SReynolds_photographs_shark_copyright_Janine_Marx-300x189.jpg 300w, ../../wp-content/uploads/2017/08/www_subdomain/SReynolds_photographs_shark_copyright_Janine_Marx-768x485.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"/><p class="wp-caption-text">Samantha Reynolds photographing a Whale Shark.

ECOCEAN scientists have been working on whale sharks at Ningaloo Reef since 1995 and have contributed to the global protection of whale sharks through reports to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and the United Nations Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). ECOCEAN also promotes conservation of whale sharks and the marine environment by engaging members of the public in its pioneering âcitizen scienceâ projects. ECOCEAN was instrumental in setting up the worldâs largest whale shark photo-identification library, now called the Wildbook for Whale Sharks, which encourages members of the public to get involved in whale shark research by submitting their photos online. The library currently has over 8000 individually identified whale sharks from over 50 countries around the world. And an innovative new program by ECOCEAN is engaging the next generation of scientists by involving school children in the satellite-tracking of whale sharks, connecting them to real-world scientific research and inspiring them to protect and conserve our precious marine environment and its inhabitants.</p><p>For more information about ECOCEAN or about the Whale Shark Race Around the World, please contact Samantha Reynolds at <a href="mailto:samantha.reynolds1@uq.net.au">mailto:samantha.reynolds1@uq.net.au</a>Â or 0424563472.

<p>As part of this review we spoke to a number of people who use the ALA on a regular basis and benchmarked our site against best practice.   This review told us that while many of our users think the ALA provides some very useful resources, at times the site can be difficult to navigate, sometimes is unstable, and that there is not enough support material.</p>
<p>We are pleased to be able to release this new and improved website as a first step to addressing some of these issues.</p>
<p>Hereâs a brief summary of what we have changed as part of this website refresh.</p>
<ul>
<li>Weâve improved how our content is grouped to make it easier for you to navigate the website. See footer navigation example below.<br><br>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ala.org.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlas of Living Australia</a> (ALA) has joined forces with <a href="http://www.bccvl.org.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biodiversity and Climate Change Virtual Laboratory</a> (BCCVL) and <a href="http://www.tern.org.au/">Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network </a>(TERN) to deliver an exciting and innovative new training program called EcoEd.</p>
<p>EcoEd provides cohesive training and skill development to university lecturers and researchers enabling them to combine theoretical concepts with real-world applications developed by three NCRIS-supported facilities (ALA, BCCVL and TERN) into undergraduate and postgraduate curriculum.</p>
<p>ALA, BCCVL and TERN developed data and products are already being used by some of Australiaâs most successful ecosystem scientists and most inspiring lecturers spread across all our universities and institutions.</p>
<p>The EcoEd program builds on these achievements, in providing the training required to further incorporate NCRIS-developed expertise and capabilities into Australiaâs higher education and research sector.</p>
<p>In doing so EcoEd is increasing the capacity of Australiaâs research community to advance science and deliver outcomes that benefit the nation and underpin the sustainable use of our ecosystems. Moreover, it is enabling first-rate science education in Australia by supporting and nurturing our future scientists.</p>

<p><strong>EcoEd Champions leading the way</strong></p>
<p>The EcoEd program was piloted this month in Adelaide where eight very enthusiastic champions from across Australia and New Zealand with varying backgrounds and institutions came together for a two day workshop. You can meet our champions below.</p>
<p>At the workshop the champions absorbed ready-to-use lecture and workshop modules, along with tools and knowledge on how to use the ALA, BCCVL and TERN platforms to explore species data and their relationships with their environment. The champions will now be incorporating these in their work and re-delivering the education materials in their own institutions.</p>
<p>EcoEd will be further developed to provide professionals teaching ecological and environmental science subjects at tertiary institutions with a wealth of information resources that can be used in courses that focus on topics such as ecology, biogeography, data fitness for use, environmental management and spatial analysis.In addition to the ALA, BCCVL & TERN, we would like to give a special thanks to  <a href="https://www.rds.edu.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Research Data Services </a>(RDS) and <a href="http://nectar.org.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National eResearch Collaboration Tools and Resources project</a> Nectar for their support in making this program happen.

            <p>This article was originally published in <a href="http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/">Biodiversity Heritage Library</a> . Read the <a href="http://blog.biodiversitylibrary.org/2017/05/a-new-scanner-for-digitizing-australias.html">original post</a>.</p>
<p>By Nicole Kearney, Coordinator, BHL Australia</p>
<p>In 2011, Australia joined the <a href="http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/">Biodiversity Heritage Library</a> and, led by Museums Victoria, began to digitize the rare books, historic journals and archival material related to Australiaâs biodiversity, and to make them openly available online.</p>
<p>There are now 15 Australian organizations contributing to BHL and over 300 worldwide. These include museums, herbaria, royal societies, field naturalists clubs and government organizations.</p>
<p>Just this week the number of volumes digitized for BHL by Australian organizations surpassed 1,000, amounting to over 200,000 pages. The great majority of this digitization work was done by the BHL Australia team at Melbourne Museum. We have a fabulous team of volunteers who scan the pages and prepare the digitized books for upload online.</p>
<div id="attachment_37907" style="width: 4042px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-37907" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2017/06/www_subdomain/IMG_7138.jpg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024"/><p class="wp-caption-text">BHL Australia volunteers with Museums Victoria CEO Lynley Marshall (center) in front of the new BHL Australia scanner.

<p>In the 6 years we have been doing this work, there have been dramatic advances in digitization technology, both in hardware and in software. We are therefore very excited to announce that BHL Australia has just purchased a new scanner.</p>
<div id="attachment_37905" style="width: 4042px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-37905" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2017/06/www_subdomain/IMG_7121.jpg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024"/><p class="wp-caption-text">Museums Victoria CEO Lynley Marshall scanning the first page for BHL Australia on the new scanner.

<p>To celebrate the arrival of the new scanner, the Museums Victoria (MV) library hosted an Open House on 24 May, inviting MV staff to learn more about BHL, see a display of rare books from the MV collection, and see the new scanner.</p>
<div id="attachment_37904" style="width: 4042px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-37904" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2017/06/www_subdomain/IMG_7095.jpg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024"/><p class="wp-caption-text">Visitors exploring rare books from the MV collection during the Open House.

<p>The scanner, a Zeutschel OS 16000, will increase both the quality and quantity of our scanning work, and will automate much of our post processing. This will allow us to further expand our project and to make even more of Australiaâs biodiversity heritage literature available online, so stay tuned for the next 200,000 pages!</p>

            <p>The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), is a member an EU-funded project, called <strong>GLOB</strong>al <strong>I</strong>nfrastructures for <strong>S</strong>upporting <strong>B</strong>iodiversity research (<a href="http://www.globis-b.eu/1/home.html">GLOBIS-B</a>). The project aims to enhance the multilateral cooperation of biodiversity research infrastructures worldwide to support the production of <a href="http://geobon.org/essential-biodiversity-variables/monitoring/">Essential Biodiversity Variables</a> (EBVs), which will provide a global approach to monitoring the state of biodiversity.</p>
<p>EBVs have been introduced by the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (<a href="http://geobon.org/">GEO BON</a>), and are the measurements required for studying, reporting, and managing biodiversity change. By implementing EBVs at a global scale, the project supports the management of biodiversity conservation and sustainable development across the world.</p>
<p>Information infrastructure is critical to delivering data for EBVs, and thatâs where the ALA as a leading global infrastructure in the aggregation and delivery of data is helping facilitate the improvement of biodiversity knowledge through the production of EBVs.</p>
<p>The ALA recently joined scientific, technical and legal experts from around the world at an EBV Workshop in Amsterdam on Species Traits.Â Â  At this workshop scientific experts discussed requirements for developing the EBV class âSpecies traitsâ. The details of designing and deploying scientific workflows to produce EBV data products were also discussed, along with the data policies that would support the use of data in the EBV process. You can find out more about this workshop at <a href="http://www.globis-b.eu/news/10/globis-b_essential_biodiversity_variables_workshop_on_species_traits_held_in_amsterdam.html">GLOBIS-B Essential Biodiversity Variables Workshop on Species Traits held in Amsterdam</a>.</p>

            <p><em><strong>ByÂ </strong></em><strong><em>Hannah Scott and Peter Brenton, Atlas of Living AustraliaÂ  </em></strong></p>
<p>Sustainable land and natural resource management relies on many things, but at the core of it, timely accurate data at the right resolution is essential for benchmarking as well as monitoring status and change.Â  Such data helps to improve productivity and yield, better manage and enhance biodiversity and natural assets, and adapt to changing climates and land use pressures.</p>
<p>Thanks to rapidly evolving technology and publicly accessible âbig dataâ capabilities, itâs now easier to make environmental management decisions informed by large volumes of information.</p>
<div id="attachment_37730" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-37730" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2017/04/www_subdomain/dsc_27956-smaller-size.jpg" alt="User exploring ALA's powerful mapping tools." width="2000" height="1335"/><p class="wp-caption-text">The ALA features a wide range of powerful, open source mapping and analysis tools, which allow users to explore and analyse information in new ways.</p></div>
<p>With open access to millions of digital records at your fingertips, Australiaâs national biodiversity database, the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) has a range of online tools and services that support environmental management and allow biodiversity and environmental information to be analysed in new ways.</p>
<p>A common question asked by Landcarers is, âWhat should I be planting on my property to minimise changing climate impacts and maximise the long-term success of my plantings?âÂ  The ALA is being used to help answer questions like this, along with questions such as, âI want to grow a particular crop, where are the best places to do this, both today and under future climate scenarios?â.Â  The potential questions are endless, but some useful case studies have been put together at <a href="http://www.ala.org.au/faq/spatial-portal/spatial-portal-case-studies/">Spatial Portal Case Studies</a>.</p>
<p>The ALAâs âexplore your areaâ feature allows you to enter a location and very quickly find and access records of species found in that area.Â  Alternatively, you might already know the species you want to plant, but want to see if it is appropriate to plant in your location.Â  The ALA allows you to search for species via maps as well as by query and filtering, access occurrence data and get information about the species found. You can even import your own data temporarily and use ALAâs powerful tools to visualise and analyse it, together with all of the other ALA data.</p>
<p>With over 67 million digital occurrence records at your fingertips to-date, the ALA has troves of information about Australiaâs living things including species and their environments. Â It can be used in multiple ways for the experienced conservation planner, researcher or ecologist; farmers, teachers, gardening enthusiasts, and the general public.</p>

          <h2 class="subject-title">Setting the benchmark for a streamlined approach to environmental data management</h2>
          <p class="subject-byline"><!--By Hannah Scott, -->March 16, 2017</p>
<p class="subject-byline">Categories: <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/category/blogs-news/" title="View all posts in ALA Blog"><span class="label label-ala">ALA Blog</span></a> <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/category/data/" title="View all posts in Data"><span class="label label-ala">Data</span></a> </p>        </article>

            <p>The NSW Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH) and the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) have teamed up to produce an integrated data feed to enable researchers more efficient access to environmental data across NSW. This collaboration sets the benchmark for a more streamlined approach to environmental data management across Australia.</p>
<p>OEHâs BioNet team has created an Open Application Programing Interface (API) that anyone can use, with the ALA (a database of Australiaâs national biodiversity information) now on board as an early adopter. The API allows NSW species sightings data to automatically synchronise between the two platforms.</p>
<p>Since going live in October 2016, the benefits of the integrated data feed have already been realised. <em>âOn the launch of the integration, we immediately saw the holdings of records from NSW OEH into the ALA increase from 7 million to 9 million records,â </em>said Miles Nicholls, Data Manager ALA<em>, âGiven that NSW OEH is the second largest supplier of data to the ALA, this represents a significant increase in the data available on NSW for research purposes.â</em></p>
<p>According to BioNetâs Project Manager, James Bibby, the key goal of this collaboration is to demonstrate momentum and capability of the API, and encourage other states across Australia to adopt of a consistent international standard. â<em>We took the decision to standardise the exchange protocol for all our BioNet OpenAPIs using the international OASIS OData standard, but on top of this we needed to select a data standard specific to sharing species sightings</em>âÂ said James Bibby Project Manager, NSW OEH.Â  â<em>It was natural for us to turn to the ALA as the national hub for sharing species sightings data and align with them where possible. A great outcome of this project is that the NSW BioNet data you can now access through the ALA platform is so much more up to dateâÂ </em></p>
<p>This collaborative effort between the ALA and OEH was also focused on aligning with best-practice data standards for the BioNet Web Service. Using open agreed standards will reduce the cost of integration of data sharing.Â  â<em>The ALA are using Darwin Core </em><em>standard reference for sharing information on biological diversity</em> <em>which has broad international support â so it made perfect sense to adopt the standard,â </em>said James Bibby<em>.Â âOur open data initiative is all about mobilizing data and having it used to drive improved biodiversity outcomes.âÂ  </em></p>
<p><em>Â </em><em>âThe adoption of standards which have broad support in the community and by technology providers is clearly the way to break down barriers to access and integrate the data, and to interpret and understand it,</em>â said James Bibby.</p>
<p>The ALA and OEH are now exploring future collaboration opportunities, including how to harvest data back to OEH and increase the data available to the State in order to improve evidence based decision making while utilising the ALA as a hub to distribute data to other government agencies.</p>

<p>We caught up with Emily to find out about her experience as a Vacation Student as well as her plans to build a solar car to race from Darwin to Adelaide.</p>

<p><strong>Whatâs the best thing about being a CSIRO vacation student at the ALA?</strong></p>
<p>The best thing about working at CSIRO and the ALA over summer has definitely been the opportunity to work on a project thatâs quite different to what I usually study in class. Itâs meant Iâve been able to learn about biodiversity and data in a context with real impact, speak with passionate researchers about their projects, and discover whatâs important in making biodiversity data suitable for a project.</p>
<p><strong>What are you studying at university?</strong></p>
<p>Iâm just about to start the third year of my Bachelor of Engineering (Research & Development), majoring in mechanics and materials.</p>
<p><strong>How do you think being a vacation scholar with the ALA has prepared you for any future work within your research field?</strong></p>
<p>Being a vacation scholar has allowed me to work on my own research project, and gain valuable research skills which will be transferable to any project I work on in the future. Working on a research project is very different to working on other projects; itâs generally much more self-driven, and requires a lot more discipline in terms of time management and avoiding procrastination. Literature reviews and reports wonât just write themselves funnily enough!</p>
<p><strong>Whatâs the next big science thing you are most excited about?</strong></p>
<p>Iâm super excited about advances in space technology, and particularly for space travel. New environments and challenges always create opportunities for creative problem solving and tech breakthroughs that have the potential to majorly improve how we approach certain problems here on Earth. So many every day technologies have come about as a result of the unique problems space poses, and itâll be exciting to see what will be developed in the next few years.</p>
<p>Iâm also really excited about the growth in the renewables sector, and the greater focus on sustainable design. Itâs always made sense to me to design things with longevity and sustainability in mind, so itâs awesome to see these ideas filtering into various aspects of technology, and products and buildings being designed to have as minimal an environmental impact as possible.</p>
<p><strong>What do you like to do in your spare time?</strong></p>
<p>I spend most of my spare time project managing ANUâs world solar challenge team, Sol Invictus. Weâre in the process of building a solar car to race from Darwin to Adelaide in October this year.</p>
<p>When Iâm not busy helping to secure sponsorship for the team or making sure our technical designs are on track, Iâm working on something for Fifty50 â a student led organisation that promotes gender equity in STEM. Iâm currently helping organise the o-week activities, and have been involved as a mentor and mentee in the past.</p>
<p>In between all of these things, I enjoy reading, going to the movies, and catching up with my friends, many of whom live interstate or overseas.</p>

<p><strong>What are you most excited for in 2017?</strong></p>
<p>Getting our solar car across the finish line in October. Itâll be amazing to see the culmination of nearly two yearsâ worth of work, on a student led project that has involved over 50 students from all across the university.</p>

<p>Dear Atlas of Living Australia friends,</p>
<p>As 2016 draws to a close, Iâd like to take this opportunity to thank you for your ongoing support to the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA). It is you, as members of our community that have made our achievements possible and make us what we are today.</p>
<p>The end of the year is a time for reflection, and for the ALA 2016 has been very productive. Here are just a few highlights Iâd like to share before we all head off on a well-deserved break over the holiday season.</p>
<p><strong>Field data collection now better than ever </strong></p>
<p>This year we proudly launched the first production release of BioCollect, our new data collection tool (replacing the old FieldData system), for collecting observation, survey and activity data. <a href="http://www.ala.org.au/biocollect/">BioCollect</a> is integrated with other ALA tools and allows you to easily create and manage projects and data collection surveys which provide a more seamless flow of biodiversity occurrence data into the ALA.</p>
<p>BioCollect supports the growing needs of both scientists wanting to engage the public in their research and the public wanting to participate in important scientific work. We are continuing to enhance and evolve the system in collaboration with our ever-growing community of users.</p>
<p><strong>Continuing our global reach </strong></p>
<p>Working with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (<a href="http://www.gbif.org/">GBIF</a>), we continue to facilitate other countries to develop biodiversity information platforms using ALA e-infrastructure. The ALAâs open source platform is becomingÂ a critical component within the GBIF network. Spain, France, Portugal, Costa Rica, Argentina, Brazil and Scotland have used ALAâs open infrastructure to help establish national biodiversity information portals, with several other countries investigating its use.</p>
<p><strong>Indigenous Ecological Knowledge </strong></p>
<p>In partnership with Indigenous communities working on country, weâre exploring the role of information management platforms in bridging the boundaries between traditional Indigenous ecological knowledge and western science, as well as empowering two-way participation in the sharing of biodiversity knowledge.Â  This year we have made good progress to improve the relevance of the ALA website and software looking towards how using both knowledge systems can give a broader perspective on Australiaâs amazing biodiversity.</p>
<p><strong>Science Symposium</strong></p>
<p>For the first time, the 2016 ALA Science Symposium was heldÂ interstate and hosted by one of our partners, the Department of Parks and Wildlife in Perth, Western Australia. We had a full program, with many stimulating talks.Â  Thank you to everyone who helped make the 2016 ALA Science Symposium such a success. Â This includes presenters, moderators, ALA staff, and also all the participants who contributed through attending and creating such a lively atmosphere.</p>
<p>The 2016 Science Symposium was such a success that next year weâre committed to making it even better. To make this happen, weâre joining forces with several other National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS) facilities to co-host a combined Environmental Symposium.Â  Keep an eye out for details in the early New Year.</p>
<p><strong>A milestone achievement </strong></p>
<p>In September we reached a pretty impressive milestone, with over eight billion records downloaded from the ALA. Weâre pleased to see that so many people are getting value from the ALA and it goes to the heart of our open access principle â collect data once, make it freely accessible and discoverable, and use it many times!</p>
<p><strong>New features and improvements </strong></p>
<p>This year saw the launch of many new features and improvements to the ALA. The redesign of species profiles and improvements to search functionality, additional features to better share data across other platforms, and new functionality to improve how users download data just to name a few.Â  We also upgraded the names management infrastructure to allow much faster updates to taxonomy and implemented an important feature to allow record owners to verify and comment on annotated records.Â  Weâre always working on improving the ALA site and will continue to make improvements in the New Year.Â  If you have any suggestions for future improvements weâre always open to feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Streamlining data cleaning and modelling </strong></p>
<p>Throughout 2016 we teamed up with the Biodiversity and Climate Change Virtual Laboratory (<a href="http://www.bccvl.org.au/">BCCVL</a>) to run a series of workshops on how to get the most out of the ALAâs Spatial Portal and BCCVLâs modelling tools.Â  The workshops were run at conferences and events around the country from Perth to Hobart and many stops in between.Â  We also worked together to better integrate the two platforms so that users are able to find, investigate and clean ALA occurrence records using the tools in the ALA and then, at the click of a button, push this data set directly to the BCCVL ready to be used in models.</p>
<p><strong>In the classroom </strong></p>
<p>The ALA is a wonderful resource for the classroom, and in 2016 we were successful in gaining accreditation through the Teacher Quality Institute (TQI) to run workshops for primary and secondary school teachers in the ACT. We ran our first accredited teacher workshop in November with 17 participants. Teacher workshops were also run through the Australian Association for Environmental Education and the Science Teachersâ Association of Victoria. Keep an eye open for more teacher workshops early in 2017.</p>
<p><strong>The National Research Infrastructure Roadmap is out</strong></p>
<p>You may have seen that Department of Education and Training has released the Draft 2016 National Research Infrastructure Roadmap which is available on the <a href="http://www.education.gov.au/2016-national-research-infrastructure-roadmap">Departmentâs web page</a>.Â  The 2016 National Research Infrastructure Roadmap will be used to support future investment decisions that will ensure Australian researchers can access world class major national research infrastructure. The ALA looks forward to the outcomes of this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, I would like to thank all of our colleagues, partners, collaborators and contributors who have made these achievements possible. I would also like to give a special thanks to all ALA staff. The many achievements listed above are a direct result of our hard-working ALA family.</p>
<p>Finally, I wish you a safe and happy break over the holiday season, and I look forward to an even bigger 2017.</p>
<p>John La Salle</p>
